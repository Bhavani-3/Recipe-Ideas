# Recipe Ideas Application

## Overview

The **Recipe Ideas** application helps busy professionals, like Taylor, to find recipe ideas based on the ingredients they have at home. Whether you're looking for a quick meal or something more elaborate, this app provides recipe suggestions to fit your needs.

Taylor can search for recipes based on the ingredients available in their kitchen, what they're in the mood for, or how much time they have to cook. The app uses the **TheMealDB API** to fetch recipe data based on the userâ€™s input.

## Features

- **Search Recipes by Ingredients**: Users can input ingredients they currently have, and the app will provide recipe suggestions.
- **View Recipe Details**: Each recipe includes information about the ingredients needed, preparation steps, and images of the dish.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app is designed with simplicity and usability in mind, so users can easily find recipes without much effort.
- **Responsive**: The app is optimized for both desktop and mobile use.

## API Used

This application integrates with the **TheMealDB API** to fetch recipe information. The API is used to retrieve recipes based on the ingredients provided by the user.

### API Endpoint:
To search recipes based on an ingredient, we use the following API:

- Replace `{ingredient}` with the ingredient the user enters (e.g., chicken, tomatoes, etc.).

## How It Works

1. **Input Ingredients**: The user enters one or more ingredients into the input field.
2. **Search for Recipes**: The app sends a request to the **TheMealDB API** with the user's ingredients.
3. **Display Recipe Suggestions**: Recipes that match the user's ingredients are displayed, along with details like:
   - List of required ingredients.
   - Step-by-step instructions for preparing the recipe.
   - Images of the dish.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (for building the UI)
- **API**: TheMealDB API (for fetching recipes based on ingredients)
- **Styling**: CSS (or Tailwind CSS, depending on your choice)

## Installation
